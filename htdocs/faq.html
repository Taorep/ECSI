            <!------------------------------ ANSWERS ---------------------------->
            <h2>ANSWERS</h2>
            <p class="bold" id="q1">How exactly is process control attained with FIBRotools&trade;?</p>
            <div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
            <p>FIBRotools&trade; work because of ECSI Fibrotools's FIBRoplate&trade; (Fiber-Initiated Boundary-layer Removal)
              process. It utilizes a unique fibrilic applicator to agitate and effectively reduce the boundary layer by
              up to 90%. Process control extends to the interface.</p>
            <p>The FIBRoplate&trade; process also enables a better electric field distribution, minimizing the so-called
              &quot;edge effect&quot; &#150; the tendency to create excess current density in the isolated sharp edges
              of the pattern.</p>
            <p class="answer">These two critical elements give the operator the ability to prepare high-quality MEMS
              samples regardless of design complexity.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q2">Can IKo&trade; systems be used in a clean room, multi-user facility?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes. IKo&trade; systems are currently successfully operating in both single- and multi-user
              clean room facilities.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q3"> Are IKo&trade; systems easy to install?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes, all IKo&trade; system models are turnkey systems. Simply place on a bench, attach the
              hood, and plug it in.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q4">Will the brushing damage the photoresist image?</p>
            <p class="answer">No. The FIBRoplate&trade; mechanism is designed to minimize the boundary layer (see
              Boundary Layer Q&amp;A), not to &quot;scrub&quot; the photoresist structure. With IKo&trade; systems, the
              operator maintains complete control of both the reciprocating action of the FIBRoplate&trade; mechanism
              and its exact distance from the pattern. These parameters are based on the MEMS thickness and pattern
              density.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q5">How frequently does the fibrilic applicator material need to be replaced?</p>
            <p class="answer">Fibrilic applicator, or &quot;brush&quot;, wear is practically nonexistent. We have been
              using the same material for hundreds of wafers and several hundred hours of operation. In the unlikely
              event that the original material does wear out, extra material is included in the 
              IKo&trade; system packaging.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q6">Do the microfibers used in IKo's&trade; fibrilic applicators cause
              contamination of the plating solution?</p>
            <p class="answer">No. The microfibers are securely attached and do not &quot;shed.&quot; In fact, it is the
              combination of our microfiber material and our fine filtration process that eliminates particulates that
              cause plating problems in traditional plating systems.</p>

            <p class="bold">What are some examples of MEMS structures that have been successfully plated with
              FIBRotools&trade;?</p>

            <p>IKo&trade; systems have been used very successfully to plate various MEMS structures, including:</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q8"> Is there a benchmark study using the FIBRotools&trade; technology?</p>
            Yes. The test results were obtained over a 5.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; square Cu seeded aluminum substrate with Cu
            plating duration 60 minutes. The nominal thickness was to be 50 microns. IKo System's&trade; test sample was
            at 51.5 micron with 1.04% Std Deviation compared to 3-7 fold bigger for the benchmark samples in a
            state-of-the-art commercial plating tool currently at the customer's site.

            <p class="bold" id="q9">What is the &quot;boundary layer&quot;?
              And why does it impede MEMS plating?</p>
            <p>The boundary,
              or diffusion, layer is the stagnant layer at the interface where
              process control is minimal. During conventional processing, this
              layer can extend 50-100 microns above your resist. Since many MEMS
              features are themselves 100 microns deep, you essentially lose process
              control 200 microns from the bottom of the resist mold. IKo Systems&trade; virtually eliminate the boundary
              layer, extending process control
              to the interface. (<a href="technology.html#diagram">see process diagrams</a>)</p>


            <p class="bold" id="q10">Can I maintain deposit quality by maintaining
              only the bulk solution composition?</p>
            <p>Maintaining bulk
              solution composition quality is only one of several prerequisites
              for maintaining deposit quality. When plating features smaller than
              50-100 microns (i.e. MEMS, ICs, etc.), it becomes a secondary issue
              because the bulk solution never reaches the solid interface where
              the plating occurs.</p>
            <p>In order to maintain deposit quality for these microscopic
              features the plating equipment must be able to:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>minimize the Boundary layer that forms at the solid/liquid
                interface (see Boundary Layer Q&amp;A). [If the boundary layer
                is not minimized, 2. and 3. below become unachievable.]</li>
              <li>maintain interfacial solution uniformity across
                the entire wafer</li>
              <li>maintain the interfacial solution level (next to
                the bulk solution) across the entire wafer</li>
              <li>and, maintain bulk solution composition at the
                prescribed level. Conventional electroplating systems have an
                inherent limitation for sub 100 micron features &#150; they are
                not able to sufficiently and uniformly minimize the boundary layer.
                Thus, they are not able to extend deposit control to where it
                is needed &#150; at the solid/liquid interface. IKo systems<span class="answer">&trade;</span> are
                specifically designed to address this drawback of conventional
                plating systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="bold" id="q11">How
                do IKo&trade; systems help produce high grade homogeneous alloy deposits
                such as Permalloy and Solder?</p>
            <p class="answer">Deposit composition
              and quality (regardless of the metal used) depend primarily on the
              solution composition at the solid/liquid interface where electroplating
              takes place. By changing of the thickness of the boundary layer
              that forms at the solid/liquid interface (see &quot;Boundary Layer&quot;
              Q/A), the composition of the resulting
              alloy can be modified. FIBRotools&trade; unique reciprocating technology gives the
              user an unprecedented level of control over this boundary layer thickness, and consequently the
              ability to manipulate the composition of the deposited alloy.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q12">How do FIBRotools&trade; maintain bulk solution
                composition?</p>
            <p class="answer">IKo&trade; systems are designed
              to operate with both insoluble and soluble anodes, depending on
              the type of metal and thickness of deposit required. For insoluble
              metals such as Gold, Palladium and Platinum an insoluble anode is
              recommended. For soluble metals such as Ni, Cu, Sn, SnPb the choice
              of the anode depends on the thickness of the deposit. Specially
              designed Titanium baskets enable users the choice of soluble material
              and dual or multiple anode, for maintaining solution composition
              in long runs and thick deposits.</p>
            <p class="bold" id="q13">What
                is a &quot;conventional&quot; electroplating process?</p>
              <p>Any electroplating process that relies exclusively on pumps, jets, paddles or nozzles to circulate the chemical solution.</p>

              <p class="bold" id="q14">What causes defects in MEMS electroplating?</p> 
              <p>
              Aside from
              an inappropriate selection of electroplating solution, defects can
              be attributed to:</p>
            <ol class="answer">
              <li> Inadequate substrate preparation. A uniform seed
                layer must adhere to the substrate. In addition, all exposed seed
                layer areas, at the bottom of the mold formed by the resist, must
                be free of resist leftovers and organic contamination. This is
                true, regardless of what electroplating equipment you use.
              </li>
              <li> Inadequate exchange of matter at the interface.
                Electroplating solution, all by itself, works perfectly well on
                easy to access surfaces &#150; where the boundary layer is insignificant.
                But, it fails in the hard to reach areas of microscopic features
                -- where the boundary layer is greater than the features being
                plated. Eliminating the boundary layer and getting matter to exchange
                in these areas is one of the IKo&trade; system's primary tasks.
              </li>
              <li> Inadequate electric field distribution. A non-uniform
                electric field can cause the &quot;edge effect&quot; or uneven
                thickness within a single MEMS and across the entire wafer. There
                are several ways to improve electric field distribution. One is
                by redesigning the pattern. Another is by applying a pulsing current.
                Yet another important way is by reducing the distance, while altering
                the resistance, between the wafer and the anode &#150; a proprietary
                feature of the IKo&trade; family of products.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="bold" id="q15">What
                is &quot;deposit porosity?&quot; And how does it happen?</p>
              <p> 
              Bubbles. A byproduct of electroplating is hydrogen gas. Bubbles of this gas
              get trapped in your deposit. FIBRotools&trade; reduce these gas bubble
              occlusions by two means: first, the wafer is positioned so that
              the plated surface is facing solution surface so that the bubbles
              tend to escape by buoyancy; secondly, the solution is forced into
              the pattern cavities where the bubbles may form thus forcing the
              bubbles to leave the plated surface. Whatever gas bubbles appear
              are quickly removed from the site.</p>

                is the smallest size feature/section that IKo&trade; systems can
                electroplate?</p>
            <p>IKo&trade; systems have demonstrated exceptional performance with nanometer
              features.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q17">What wafer sizes can I electroplate with IKo&trade; systems?</p>
            <p>With IKo&trade; systems, you can electroplate any wafer between
              2&quot; and 8&quot; diameter as well as wafer chips 2 centimeter
              square and up. In addition, you can electroplate square and other
              shape substrates&nbsp;less then 100 microns up to 10 mm thick.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q18">Can IKo&trade; systems be used for seedless
                (SL) electroplating of highly-doped silicon?</p>
            <p>Yes, our proprietary technique enables seedless electroplating without physical modification of
              the silicon wafer. The IKo&trade; system ensures uniform current distribution without a copper
              current collector. See
              <a href="addonoptions.html">Add-on Options</a> for more information.</p>

            <p class="bold" id="q19">Can IKo&trade; systems be used for
                electroplating under a magnetic field?</p>
            <p>Yes, IKo&trade; systems can be used to perform electroplating under a magnetic field of nominally 1,000
              oersted. See
              <a href="addonoptions.html">Add-on Options</a> for more information.</p>
