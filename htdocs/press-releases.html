      <h4>May, 2017</h4>
      <h4>Introducing FiBRotools&trade; Electrochemical Printing Technology (EPT)</h4>

      <p>FiBRotools&trade; EPT is a new, patent-pending application of FiBRotools&trade;
      electroplating technology to flexible electronic circuits. Using contact electroplating,
      FiBRotools&trade; EPT enables uniform, direct electroplating of isolated patterns without the
      need for peripheral electrical contacts.</p>

      <p> ECSI Fibrotools founder Dr. Igor Kadija demonstrated how this new technology can be applied to flexible
        electronics at TechConnect World Innovation Conference in Washington, D.C. Read his conference paper
    <a href="pdfs/The-Electrochemical-Printing-Technique-for-Flexible-Electronics.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

	  	<p>This July in Atlanta, GA,  Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRIS) from ETH, Zurich,   Switzerland, won the  competition in Nanogram Robotic Soccer division. IRIS&nbsp; introduced for the first time electroplated  MEMS parts in their microrobots. </p>
	  	<p>Another example of FIBRotools&#8482; efficiency. IRIS  is making the most of its IKoClassic by educating generations of engineers in  precise and efficient MEMS electroplating. ECSI FIBRotools&#8482;  benchtop electroplater is currently used worldwide by many academic and R&amp;D  institutions.</p>

		MEMS/NANO structures and HDIs - continues to expand its domestic and worldwide sales in
		the first half of 2007. New customers include the University of Central Florida, Orlando,
		the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA.
		Internationally, ECSI delivered IKoClassic to the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai,
		India.</p>

		<p>Purchasers cited three main reasons for their selection of ECSI equipment: the operator
		can even with limited electroplating skills reliably achieve reproducible, quality
		results on a wide range of substrate sizes from small wafer sections up to 8" wafers;
		equipment delivers an exceptional performance/price ratio; and, ECSI offers a superior
		technical support.</p>

        (UCL, Louvain-la-Neuve), FINLAND (Coherent, Tampere)
        and KOREA (Korea Institute of industrial Technology,
        Incheon). Purchasers cited two main reasons for their
        selection of ECSI equipment: the unique design of IKoClassic
        that enables even an operator with limited electroplating
        skills to reliably achieve reproducible, quality results;

      <p><u>New FIBRotools&#8482; electroplater for MEMS and
        HDIs</u></p>
      <p>Twice the speed means twice the production. ECSI now
        offers a new version of its popular IKo&trade; bench-top electroplater.
        This spring it introduced IKo-2W6, a bench-top electroplater
        that allows simultaneous processing of multiple 2&rdquo; to
        8&rdquo; wafers. IKo-2W6 is capable of electroplating
        and electroforming 2 wafers in the same plating solution,
        with identical or entirely different operating parameters,
        if needed. It promises to be an exceptional tool for
        fast R&amp;D and/or small scale production.&nbsp; The
        first sale of IKo-2W6 went to a major supplier of specialty
        chemicals for electronics and MEMS manufacturers. </p>
